						<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse1"><p></p>

							<p>Chiou Ho-shun was first sentenced to death for the murder of a woman and the kidnapping and murder of a boy in 1989. He was one of 12 defendants the police held for four months, during which time they were subjected to torture and had consequently confessed to the murders. They later retracted their confessions. In 1994, two prosecutors and 10 police officers were punished for using torture to obtain confessions in one of the cases. Up to this date, the penalty has remained.

							Amnesty International and a former UN special rapporteur on torture have raised serious concerns about this case, pointing to the torture, long detention, and violation against the right to a fair trial.</p>

						<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse2"><p></p>

							<p>In 1995, a real estate businessman named Huang Chun-shu was kidnapped and murdered. On September 25, 1995, police arrested Huang Chun-Chi in Taoyuan, who claimed that he had two accomplices: Chen Yi-lung and Hsu Tzu-chiang. On September 28, the police announced that they had solved the case, prompting Hsu Tzu-chiang to flee for fear of being tortured into a confession. He remained in hiding until June 24, 1996, when accompanied by counsel, he surrendered to the Shilin District Court.

							JRF has fought for Hsu for the past 21 years, and he was ultimately found innocent and was acquitted on October 13, 2016. He now works at JRF and regularly gives speeches about his story to raise public awareness of the  unfair judiciary in Taiwan. Documentaries and books related to his case are also released in 2017.</p>

						<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse3"><p></p>

							<p>In September 1996, a young girl was raped and murdered in the Taipei Da-An District Air Force Headquarters. Within a month, a 20 year-old Private First Class named Chiang Kuo-ching was determined to be the perpetrator. He was charged and tried in a military tribunal and, in August 1997, executed.

							On January 28, 2011, the Taipei Prosecutor's Office summoned Hsu Rong-chou for questioning in relation to the case. The news of the real murderer emerging compelled society to face the horrifying fact that Chiang Kuo-ching had been wrongfully executed.

							JRF has been involved with the case since February 1, 2011 by assisting a team of pro bono lawyers. On October 26, 2011, following Chiang’s not guilty verdict on retrial, the military court granted the family compensation in the sum of TWD 103, 185, 000. The JRF believes, however, that monetary compensation alone cannot conclude the Chiang case. Rather, follow-up review and continued investigations are critical. Hopefully, society will continue to scrutinize the case’s developments and guide justice onto its rightful path.</p>

						<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse4"><p></p>

							<p>On March 17, 2014 KMT Internal Administration Committee member Chang, Ching-Chong passed the motion of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement in less than 30 seconds before sending it off the Commission. This act violates the rules of negotiation of ruling and opposition parties to examine the proposals, which prompted many students and social groups to take action against the black box scandal. That night, many demonstrators rushed into the Legislative Yuan and occupied the debating field. Although the police couldn’t overwhelm them, there were still a struggling between police and crowd. Confrontations between the demonstrators and the police quickly escalated to a social movement, later called the “318 Movement”.

							According to Ma’s government indifference on former demonstration, the "3/23 Event" broke out due to protestors occupying the Executive Yuan. After demonstrators were evacuated from the Legislative Yuan, the police forcibly removed protestors from the Alliance of Referendum for Taiwan from their legitimate demonstrating area on 4/11, which caused “Pass by 1st division of Chong-Chen District Police Office “. Also, the "6/26 Event" in which demonstrators voiced out their oppositing opinions by occupying the road to stop the visiting march of Chang, Chih-Cheung broke out.

							During the 318 Movement, JRF set up a 24-hour investigation service, which allows protesters to seek legal assistance upon arrest. A pro-bono lawyer platform was also established to help follow-up and provide further assistance to seek compensation for victims who suffered injuries caused by public institutions.</p>
