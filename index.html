						<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse1"><p></p>

							<p>Chiou Ho-shun was first sentenced to death for the murder of a woman and the kidnapping and murder of a boy in 1989. He was one of 12 defendants the police held for four months, during which time they were subjected to torture and confessed to the murders. They later retracted their confessions. In 1994, two prosecutors and 10 police officers were punished for using torture to obtain confessions in one of the cases. By now the penalty is still remained.

							Amnesty International and a former UN special rapporteur on torture have raised serious concerns about this case, pointing to the torture, the long detention, and violation of the right to a fair trial.</p>

						<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse2"><p></p>

							<p>In 1995, a real estate businessman named Huang Chun-shu was kidnapped and murdered. On September 25, 1995, police arrested Huang Chun-Chi in Taoyuan, who claimed that he had two accomplices: Chen Yi-lung and Hsu Tzu-chiang. On September 28, the police announced that they had solved the case, prompting Hsu Tzu-chiang to flee for fear of being tortured into a confession. He remained in hiding until June 24, 1996, when accompanied by counsel, he surrendered to the Shilin District Court.

							After 21 years' struggle, Hsu was finally Acquitted on October 13, 2016. Now he works in JRF and give speeches about his story to raise the awareness of unfair judiciary to the public. Documentaries and books related to his case are also released in 2017. This is the first rescue</p>

						<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse3"><p></p>

							<p>In September 1996, a young girl was raped and murdered in the Taipei Da-An District Air Force Headquarters. Within a month, a 20 year-old Private First Class named Chiang Kuo-ching was determined to be the perpetrator. He was charged and tried in a military tribunal and, in August 1997, executed.

							On January 28, 2011, the Taipei Prosecutor's Office summoned Hsu Rong-chou for questioning in relation to the case. The news of the real murderer emerging compelled society to face the horrifying fact that Chiang Kuo-ching had been wrongfully executed.

							JRF has been involved with the case since February 1, 2011 by assisting a team of pro bono lawyers. On October 26, 2011, following Chiang’s not guilty verdict on retrial, the military court granted the family compensation in the sum of TWD 103, 185, 000. The JRF believes, however, that monetary compensation alone cannot conclude the Chiang case. Rather, follow-up review and continued investigations are critical. Hopefully, society will continue to scrutinize the case’s developments and guide justice onto its rightful path.</p>
